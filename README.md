## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
I'm 24 years old who has recently graduated with a master's degree in Applied Mathematics. <br>

My interests include learning new things and increasing my knowledge, as well as reading books and playing video games. <br>

Repositories contain projects that I've been working on in the past, and I encourage you to familiarize yourself with their contents.
