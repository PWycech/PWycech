## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
I'm 24 years old who has recently graduated with a master's degree in Applied Mathematics.

My interests include learning new things and increasing my knowledge, as well as reading books and playing video games.

Repositories contain projects that I've been working on in the past, and I encourage you to familiarize yourself with their contents.

PWycech/PWycech is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
